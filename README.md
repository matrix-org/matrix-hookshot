A Matrix bot for connecting to external services like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, and more.

- Several services are supported out of the box.
- [Webhooks](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/setup/webhooks.html) let you connect all kinds of services, with the ability to write rich templates using JavaScript.
