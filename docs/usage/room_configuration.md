# Room Configuration

Hookshot works off the principle of **Connections**.

A room can have many connections to different services. The connections are defined
in the room state of a room. A connection defines the service it connects to, the
type of integration (e.g. GitHub repo, Jira Project) and any additional configuration.

Hookshot supports several connection types, which are defined under the Room Configuration
heading.

The availability of connection types depends on the configuration provided to hookshot.

### The `!hookshot` command

Rooms can be bridged by inviting the hookshot bot into a room, and then running the
`!hookshot` command. Running `!hookshot help` will give you some details, but you should
see the documentation provided for information on each connection type.
