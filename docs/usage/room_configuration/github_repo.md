# GitHub Repository

This connection type connects a GitHub repository (e.g. https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot) to a room.

You can run commands to create and manipulate issues, and receive notifications when something changes such as
a new release.

## Setting up

To set up a connection to a GitHub Repository in a new room:

(NB you must have permission to bridge GitHub repositories before you can use this command, see [auth](../auth.html#github).)

1. The bridge will need to either:
   - Have a GitHub installation registered with the organisation (or GitHub user account)
   - The requesting user must be authenticated with the bridge via OAuth and the repository must be part of their GitHub account.
2. Create a new, unencrypted room. It can be public or private.
3. Invite the bridge bot (e.g. `@hookshot:example.com`).
4. Give the bridge bot moderator permissions or higher (power level 50) (or otherwise configure the room so the bot can edit room state).
5. Send the command `!hookshot github repo https://github.com/my/project`.
6. If you have permission to bridge this repo, the bridge will respond with a confirmation message.

## Configuration

This connection supports a few options which can be defined in the room state:

[^1]: `ignoreHooks` is no longer accepted for new state events. Use `enableHooks` to explicitly state all events you want to see.

### Supported event types

This connection supports sending messages when the following actions happen on the repository.

Note: Some of these event types are enabled by default (marked with a `*`). When `ignoreHooks` _is_ defined,
the events marked as default below will be enabled. Otherwise, this is ignored.
