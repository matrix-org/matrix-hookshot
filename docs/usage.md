# Usage

This section covers how to use the bridge, once it's set up. We break these
down into categories:

- Authentication: How to connect your user account to a remote service to use
  rich commands.
- Room Connections: How to start connecting rooms to services.

If you are looking for help on what bot commands you can run in a room, you can
refer to the help information by saying\*:

- `!gh help` in rooms connected to GitHub.
- `!gl help` in rooms connected to GitLab.
- `!jira help` in rooms connected to JIRA.

\*the prefix may vary if the `commandPrefix` configuration in the room is set.
