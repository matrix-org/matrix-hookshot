Fixed Helm chart templates missing `namespace:` in resource metadata, causing some resources to appear in different namespaces under certain circumstances, specifically deployment scenarios using ArgoCD-deployed Helmfile with a release namespace set for Hookshot differently than the ArgoCD Application's namespace. Most other Helm deployment methods should continue to work as expected with your existing configuration, as the inferred namespace would have resulted in proper resource placement without this change.
