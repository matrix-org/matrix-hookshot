# 6.0.3 (2025-02-25)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed Helm chart templates missing `namespace:` in resource metadata, causing some resources to appear in different namespaces under certain circumstances, specifically deployment scenarios using ArgoCD-deployed Helmfile with a release namespace set for Hookshot differently than the ArgoCD Application's namespace. Most other Helm deployment methods should continue to work as expected with your existing configuration, as the inferred namespace would have resulted in proper resource placement without this change. ([\#1013](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1013))
- Fix hookshot failing to handle incoming webhooks when it is unable to change a user's displayname. ([\#1019](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1019))
- GitLab merge request comments are now correctly filtered based on label include / exclude configuration. ([\#1756](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1756))

### Improved Documentation

- Explain how to edit room state for GitLab projects from within Element. ([\#1016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1016))

### Internal Changes

- Update dependencies with security advisories. ([\#1024](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1024))


# 6.0.2 (2025-01-23)

### Internal Changes

- Switch to using GitHub Actions native arm runners for Docker builds, which will reduce build times. ([\#1008](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/1008))

### Security

Fixes for [CVE-2025-23197](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23197) / [GHSA-cr4q-jf47-3645](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/security/advisories/GHSA-cr4q-jf47-3645).

4.4.0 (2023-06-28)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Refactor Hookshot to use Redis for caching of feed information, massively improving memory usage.

  Please note that this is a behavioural change: Hookshots configured to use in-memory caching (not Redis),
  will no longer bridge any RSS entries it may have missed during downtime, and will instead perform an initial
  sync (not reporting any entries) instead. ([\#786](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/786))

3.0.0 (2023-03-17)
==================

This release includes some new landmark improvements to support **public Hookshots**.

One key feature is the new Go-NEB migrator. If you run a Go-NEB instance currently and are looking for a way to migrate GitHub and RSS feeds
over to Hookshot, there is a nice fancy widget feature for this.

The other feature is we have now implemented a "Grant" system for authorising new connections in rooms. Simply put when you create a new connection
in a room to a remote service like GitHub, we now store the validity of that authorisation in the bridge. This is a new change where previously we
would not persist this authorization between sessions, so it was possible for users (who were permitted in the config to `manageConnections`) to create
connections to anywhere Hookshot was already configured to talk to. This piece of extra security means we can now be more confident about allowing Hookshot
to be used in public spaces.

Upgrading to 3.0.0 **is breaking**, as the new grant system will run against any of your previous connections. It is imperative that where you have
created or edited a connection manually in the room state, that you are still authenticated to the service it is connected to. For instance, ensure
you are logged into GitHub if you have created manual GitHub connections. You can check the logs for any information on which connections have not
been granted. 

For any users who are not able to immediately update, but are nontheless worried about the consequeneces for this change: Do not panic. You can always
update the permissions in your config to only allow `manageConnections` to users you trust.

If you have any questions about this change, do not hesistate to reach out to `#hookshot:half-shot.uk`.

Features
--------

- Add support from migrating go-neb services to Hookshot ([\#647](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/647))
- Implement grant system to internally record all approved connections in hookshot. ([\#655](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/655))
