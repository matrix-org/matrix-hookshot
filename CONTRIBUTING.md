Hi there! Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for all matrix.org bridge
projects.

## Hookshot Guidelines

 - Hookshot presently uses the `main` branch as the default branch (instead of `develop`).
 - Since Hookshot caters to a range of services, we have additional tags such as `GitHub`, `GitLab`
   which help us determine which services are affected by an issue.
 - In addition to Typescript, Hookshot makes use of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). You will need to setup Rust in order to build the project. https://rustup.rs/ is a good option for most people.
 - The official hookshot support/development room is [#hookshot:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk)
